	<p class="body-text"> One of my favorite activities while traveling is going on a local walking tour, mostly because I get the chance to check out the architecture through the eyes of a local. One of the pain points I always had, however, was that I would spot an interesting construction that wasn't a part of the tour, and I would never get the opportunity to learn more about it. Great design, lost to the ether! After commiserating with fellow travelers who had passing interests in architecture, I thought I'd try and alleviate the problem. </p>

	<h3> Product Framework </h3> <br>

	<p class="body-text"> The infinity loop (borrowed from my days @ IBM) envisions product development as a continuous improvement model. The end user is placed in the middle of a research and dev loop where each loop is validated with a series of playbacks, or user interviews. As the sole developer, I knew it was crucial that I avoid costly dev missteps likely to sink motivation. </p> <br>

	<img src="/img/travel-architect/research-logo.png" class="img-fluid mb-2"> Personas </img> <br><br><br>

	<p class="body-text"> I formalized my conversations with other travelers into high level personas. These could have used a much more rigorous interview process, as well as other methodologies, but observational would have been pretty creepy and literature/ESM is non-existent. I'll note up front these were mostly sourced from my personal contacts, so obvious demographic biases are present. </p> <br>

	<img src="/img/travel-architect/user-logo.png" class="img-fluid mb-2"> Pain Point Validation </img> <br><br><br>

	<p class="body-text"> Pain points differed across business and leisure travelers, with business users bemoaning the lack of time. They would be in on a Tuesday and out on a Thursday, passing by interesting buildings on the street with no time to learn more about them. Leisure travelers loved guided tours on architecture but also found them expensive and increasingly outcompeted by travel bloggers or free <a href="https://bit.ly/2tmYUoY">self-guided tours</a>. Interestingly enough, our Cultured Cranstons were truly living the dream with narry a worry. <a href="https://www.architecturaladventures.org/"> Expensive travel packages</a> with reknowned architects as guides provided a full range of services. Costs were not a serious concern; the tour company traveled in groups of 20-25 so the social component was present; time was booked and planned well in advance; the personal, expert touch was there as well.</p>

	<img src="/img/travel-architect/research-logo.png" class="img-fluid mb-2"> Market and Competition </img> <br><br>

	<p class="body-text"> Validating the market for each of these personas and pain points was a fun exercise, especially since this was a passion project with no plans for monetization. The standard market analysis (TAM -> SAM -> Competitive Landscape -> Segmentation -> Unit Economics -> Strategic Differentiation) seemed slightly overkill, but I did end up putting some boundaries around each of those areas. Ultimately the insight around unit spend and mobile user behavior helped crystallize a GTM direction, so I dive deep on these below. </p> <br>

	<p class="body-text"> The initial cut of features was the ideal experience (the dev side of me was already cringing) and directly addressed pain points across Abigail and Bobby personas, as well as captured some of the mobile behavior insight gained via research. From a competitive standpoint, these features mostly sought to replicate the guided tour value prop while remaining free to the end user. From a GTM standpoint, I was already hazarding a guess at an iOS-only rollout due to CAC, dev experience, and potential trademark/IP issues (and prioritized accordingly)...more on that later. </p>

	<p class="body-text"> With a healthy set of features it was time to make cuts for MVP; I normally do this by presenting the ideal experience via wires and have the devs spike out and trim from there. Since I was wearing both hats this time around, I just shortened this to one loop and went pixel perfect on the wires. </p> <br><br><br>
