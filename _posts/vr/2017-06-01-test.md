A few years ago, when VR experiences started popping up at every booth at every tech conference in every city, I noticed an increasing number of articles addressing the [isolation problem](http://factor-tech.com/feature/is-virtual-reality-going-to-make-us-withdraw-from-the-real-world/) in VR -- a dystopian society some futurists envision where VR content is so compelling that segments of the population disengage from the "real world" entirely.

I find it interesting that most of these articles still don't see VR as an eventuality. Whereas IMO the single greatest risk to donning a headset and fully immersive haptic suit is the risk of being too early (or late) on the adoption curve.

  * Assume, for the purposes of this analysis, that both content and hardware are AAA, such that a headset and a haptic suit renders an experience that is not only indistuingishable from reality, but provides a 10x experience over base reality.

An early adopter has the following advantages:
  * Shape the world
  * Monetize the world

An early adopter has the following disadvantages:
  * They can be unplugged
  * They can mistime entry such that they re-enter base reality having no applicable skills
