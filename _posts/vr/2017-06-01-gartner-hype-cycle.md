A few years ago, when VR experiences started popping up at every booth at every tech conference in every city, I noticed an increasing number of articles addressing the [isolation problem](http://factor-tech.com/feature/is-virtual-reality-going-to-make-us-withdraw-from-the-real-world/) in VR -- a dystopian society some futurists envision where virtual content is so compelling that segments of the population disengage from base reality entirely.

The alarmist sentiment around VR-as-social-isolation is, to be clear, completely valid. It's also a decade too late. Because these alarmists are missing the societal trend that's already [happening](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6535284)! When virtual content provides 10x the serotonin of base reality--in all aspects of waking life from breakfast to bedtime--there remain virtually zero incentives to remain in base reality for a majority of the impoverished, marginalized, or otherwise already isolated segments of the global population. 

I believe the rate of "complete disengagement" from society accelerates in the next 5-7 years as developers continue to churn out more and more life-like content.

For the same reason, I think the hype cycle for VR is far from trending towards the plateau, as Gartner's 2017 report would indicate:

If the kind of heat Facebook is [taking](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology) is any indicator, voices battling against completely immersive experiences will only intensify. In particular, attacks against social technology as enabling "dopamine-driven feedback loops" destroying the fabric of society will find a resurgence in VR. As more and more people drop off the base reality grid in the next 5-7 years, I see immense backlash from media, pundits, and even disillusioned technologists. But they're fighting a losing battle. 

Irrespective of the negative sentiment, virtual immersion to the point of complete social isolation is an unstoppable trend. And I say this with confidence by presenting to you the same offer that hundreds of millions in the lowest 10% of global wealth distribution will receive in the next decade.

Would you like to continue struggling to eke out an existence on less than a US dollar a day? Or would you like to live in a virtual paradise?
