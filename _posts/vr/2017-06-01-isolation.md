A few years ago, when VR experiences started popping up at every booth at every tech conference in every city, I noticed an increasing number of articles addressing the [isolation problem](http://factor-tech.com/feature/is-virtual-reality-going-to-make-us-withdraw-from-the-real-world/) in VR -- a dystopian society some futurists envision where VR content is so compelling that segments of the population disengage from the "real world" entirely.

I find it interesting that most of these articles still don't see VR as an eventuality. That is, I don't see danger in entire segments of the population disengaging entirely, in fact it's already [happening](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6535284)! When the vast majority of the world's populace is primarily engaged in virtual content, I actually see the isolation problem as completely inverted. Value creation will occur almost exclusively in virtual spaces, leaving those who refuse to engage there as the isolated members. Taken a step further I believe those priced out of a fully immersive rig (haptic suit and goggles, environment that processes and eliminates waste, etc.) will have no choice but to sustain their livelihoods by supporting the primary consumers of virtual content. This could involve editing buggy content all the way down to cleaning rigs. 

What I'm summing to is the conclusion that the headline-making societal ill of the future will (still) be class disparity. The wealthy monopolize the virtual; the poor sustain the virtual ecosystem.
