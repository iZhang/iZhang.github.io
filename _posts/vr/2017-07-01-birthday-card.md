I was at QFC yesterday picking up a birthday card when I noticed a lovely new section: VR cards! These bad boys fold open into a surprise Google cardboard-esque cutout that you tear open. The one I eventually chose had an accompanying link to a video site that would render a virtual hot air balloon ride: "It's your birthday; may your goals be as high as the skies!" The quality was absolutely terrible. 

I'll let the experts review why so much VR video quality is [shoddy](https://medium.com/visbit/why-do-all-the-360-vr-videos-today-look-so-pixelated-b1ab3cba6f95) these days, but my question is really this, "Why do companies continue to put out terrible quality VR?" Yes, we understand it's a capital-intensive problem to solve. You need a camera that shoots at least 4K resolution, you take on high server costs due to minimal compression of high bandwidth video, and you suffer through a time-consuming, largely manual, stitching process. All understood. 

But if you can't produce AAA content, what value proposition is your company taking to market? Those VR cards were $12.99 a pop, meaning the average internet-aware consumer that googles "Virtual Reality" would see a Google Cardboard priced at 10$, with AAA content provided on a variety of different topics -- not simply a one-off, terribly rendered bit of content that expires in 6 months from now. The only rational analysis I have of this company's VR card release is that it targets the 65+ demographic. These are the less-than-stellar-internet-user grandpas and grandmas that pick up a novelty card for their grandkids a couple times a year.

By 2030, about 20% of the US population will be 65+, so that's an estimated 70 million geriatric stunnas. Though in reality most are not symmetrical pairings (one dies before the other), for the purposes of this I'll just assume it's roughly 50:50 men/women in this demographic, and that they're roughly paired off at 1:1. I also assume each set of grandparents has 5 grandkids on average (birth rate is roughly 2.1 kids per couple in the US). That means of the 35 million older couples in the US, they are looking at about 5 birthdays and 5 christmas cards, so in total ~10 opportunities to purchase cards per year. Of course not every grandkid gets a card, for financial reasons, family politics, etc. And some grandkids get more than 2 cards/per year due to graduations, celebration of life events, or wealthy grandparents. I am assuming this averages out to two cards per kid per year.

In the best case scenario, every grandparent coupling purchases a novelty VR card at least once in the next three years (before the early adoption phase of VR concludes). At first glance it seems to produce a 35MM x 5 VR cards x $12.99/card = $2.2B opportunity. So for a back of the napkin estimate in terms of just the top line, turns out it's not actually a bad play! Let's also consider our margins on this particular segment. We have some data on raw material and labor costs, so we start there. 

Assuming a barebones set of goggles (cardboard, lenses, magnet, NFC tag), you're looking at around just a dollar/goggle. Prices based on alibaba bulk purchases (at least 10+) of nice paper for the card, E flute cardboard, 45mm biconvex lenses, low cost neodymium magnets, velcro, and nfc tags. Labor costs sit at less than a dollar/goggle assuming manufacturing is based in China/Taiwan. The content itself, including server hosting costs, likely averages to less than a dollar/goggle given the quality of content and the exploding link time. So raw material, cost of labor, content development/hosting, all comes out to less than 3$/goggle here--doing pretty good so far! 

Next we look at marketing, R&D, executive payouts, and more peripheral costs. Marketing costs seem to be nearly non-existent in this space, given existing relationships with retail distributors. R&D costs are likely minimal, given it's probably a different spec/blueprint provided to the manufacturer and the factory drones scale from there. And I can't imagine Hallmark doling out golden parachutes left and right. Let's slot this at less than a dollar/goggle.

Finally, there's interest expenses, taxes, write-offs, etc. that encompass day to day operations at a given company. Again I assume for a behemoth like Hallmark that owns a lionshare of the greeting card market, that VR gimmick added to their product line is not likely to add massive cost to d2d operations. 

So worst case scenario we're looking at around 4$/goggle. Assuming worst case retail markup at 100% we're still at 8$/goggle. Meaning net margin on these babies around 30%. If that seems crazy high, I think it's because someone at Hallmark is very smart. Because while they are producing absolute garbage content, the novelty of the space gives them breathing room on pricing. About 30% worth of breathing room. Hallmark's net profit margin as of today is -1%, so someone is getting a raise.
