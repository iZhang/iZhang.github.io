I was at QFC yesterday picking up a birthday card when I noticed a lovely new section: VR cards! These bad boys fold open into a surprise Google cardboard-esque cutout that you tear open. The one I eventually chose had an accompanying link to a video site that would render a virtual hot air balloon ride: "It's your birthday; may your goals be as high as the skies!" The quality was absolutely terrible. 

I'll let the experts review why so much VR video quality is [shoddy](https://medium.com/visbit/why-do-all-the-360-vr-videos-today-look-so-pixelated-b1ab3cba6f95) these days, but my question is really this, "Why do companies continue to put out terrible quality VR?" Yes, we understand it's a capital-intensive problem to solve. You need a camera that shoots at least 4K resolution, you take on high server costs due to minimal compression of high bandwidth video, and you suffer through a time-consuming, largely manual, stitching process. All understood. 

But if you can't produce AAA content, what value proposition is your company taking to market? Those VR cards were $12.99 a pop, meaning the average internet-aware consumer that googles "Virtual Reality" would see a Google Cardboard priced at 10$, with AAA content provided on a variety of different topics -- not simply a one-off, terribly rendered bit of content that expires in 6 months from now. The only rational analysis I have of this company's VR card release is that it targets the 65+ demographic. These are the less-than-stellar-internet-user grandpas and grandmas that pick up a novelty card for their grandkids once or twice a year. 

By 2030, about 20% of the US population will be 65+, so that's an estimated 70 million geriatric stunnas. Though in reality most are not symmetrical pairings (one dies before the other), for the purposes of this I'll just assume it's roughly 50:50 men/women in this demographic, and that they're roughly paired off at 1:1. I also assume each set of grandparents has 5 grandkids on average (birth rate is roughly 2.1 kids per couple in the US). That means of the 35 million older couples in the US, they are looking at about 5 birthdays and 5 christmas gifts, so in total 10 opportunities to purchase cards per year. Of course not every grandkid gets a card, for financial reasons, family politics, etc. And some grandkids get more than 2 cards/per year due to graduations, celebration of life events, or wealthy grandparents. I assume this averages out to two cards per kid per year. 

In the best case scenario, every grandparent coupling purchases a novelty VR card at least once in the next three years (before the early adoption phase of VR concludes). At first glance it seems to produce a 35MM x 5 VR cards x $12.99/card = $2.2B opportunity. But...
