My team at work fully embraces OSS, and that gives me exposure to a pretty wide range of awesome, cutting-edge tools to execute on my job. For prototyping, [Adobe Experience Design](http://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) has been a life saver. I can pull a designer and a dev lead into a meeting, with only XD on the screen, and walk out of there a few hours later with vetted, high-def mockups of a product prototype. 

Sketch, Mural, Balsamiq, etc. are all great tools for quick wireframing, but XD skips all of that and allows you to go straight from concept to quality mockups. Personally, I love how I can eliminate a ton of lost-in-translation moments. When someone asks "oh, how would that button toggle work," instead of erasing and re-drawing on paper, I can collaborate in realtime with them and A/B test a few different scenarios, using an actual button press, modal flyout, or dropdown. 

That collaboration is so key to the future of user-oriented design, and makes Adobe's [acquisition](http://news.adobe.com/press-release/creative-cloud/adobe-continues-drive-360-video-and-vr-innovation-acquisition-mettles) of Skybox an incredibly forward-thinking play. Skybox does post-production effects and editing for 360/VR video, and thinking about integrating that plugin into XD should make most of our heads explode. While the use cases are everywhere, imagine industrial ones for a minute. Instead of sending a team of tech-sales guys onsite to show Customer A a completely unrelated demo of Customer B, do a drone flyover of your asset line. Then start layering virtual assets (with IoT enabled solutions) on top of that footage in real time; A/B test it with your customer in real time; start gathering requirement outlines; rake in the commissions.
