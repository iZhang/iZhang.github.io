Since my product area is IIoT, I have the fortune of devoting a small chunk of my day to researching up and coming companies in the space. An area that is generating immense interest from customers on the ground is in augmented reality. Many companies, across verticals as diverse as manufacturing, telecom, and transportation, see a great opportunity to improve the day to day of their "boots on the ground." These folks are the operators, technicians, and OT experts who keep our world running, 24/7/365.  

Accordingly in the past few years a wellspring of high-potential AR companies have entered the industrial space, tackling the obvious use cases around training and guided maintenance, as well as the complex use cases around anomaly detection and quality control. 

Since I'm tracking so many of these companies already, I thought I'd start an ecosystem map for AR in IIoT, and come back every few months and update it--either with exit valuations on the ones I find super promising, or with updates on actual exits. 

Below is the first cut of it:

Each circle represents a use case, with each successive layer encompassing the ones above. For instance Ubimax has a portfolio of products that already tackle all of these important AR use cases, from quality control all the way up through training. 

I'm excited to deep dive into these companies, and I think we'll see some exciting M&A deals all the way up the stack this year as IIoT solutions start to move beyond platform building and into solutioning.
