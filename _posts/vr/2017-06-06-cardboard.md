Google continues to impress me with the long term product vision that leaves other companies just one step behind. A massive roadblock to widescale VR [adoption](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2017/03/03/the-hype-around-virtual-reality-is-fading/#740561141344) is the lack of AAA content -- most people just don't want to strap on a clunky headset and engage with hours worth of pixelated content. In addition, the technology behind existing platforms and engines to generate that desired content still lags far behind the vision and potential of creators/developers. So you're stuck with hardcore designers spending days, sometimes weeks, in engines like Unity to generate one frame of a pixel-perfect environment. Not exactly scalable.

Google, since it's now approaching some 10MM cardboard headsets [shipped](https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14767902/google-cardboard-10-million-shipped-vr-ar-apps), had the foresight to skip this problem altogether. While the company continues to invest aggressively via acquisition and homegrown development in the underpinning technologies, it has also realized that real life is as close to AAA as you can get. All you need is the proper equipment!

Possibly my favorite application of any I've seen on VR platforms is Google's [Arts and Culture](https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/theme/mwJiZHf_Y7FfLg) experience, where they film tours of exhibits in 360 video. This is done in conjunction with many of the most respected museums, artists, and other cultural organizations around the world -- allowing the curious student or enterprising teacher to bring AAA, international, educational content to classrooms. Did I mention each cardboard is still priced at 10$/pop? 

Of course, as is the Google way, access to this is free. But you can bet your bottom dollar that as soon as the user base approaches critical mass for Google's VR platform, the ad spend per hour is going to grow Alphabet's top line by a significant amount. The potential for monetization is extraordinary here, as travel companies, booking companies, and really the entire travel ecosystem makes a play for targeted ads.
