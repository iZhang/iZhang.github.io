A few years ago, when VR experiences started popping up at every booth at every tech conference in every city, I noticed an increasing number of articles addressing the [isolation problem](http://factor-tech.com/feature/is-virtual-reality-going-to-make-us-withdraw-from-the-real-world/) in VR -- a dystopian society some futurists envision where virtual content is so compelling that segments of the population disengage from base reality entirely.

I find it interesting that most of these articles still don't see immersive VR as an eventuality for the majority of the world's population. Westworld logistics aside, when virtual content provides 10x the serotonin of base reality--in all aspects of waking life from breakfast to bedtime--there remain virtually zero incentives to stay in base reality. In fact, as developers increasingly deliver AAA content, I foresee a massive rush to monetize common VR spaces. 

To explain that point let's walk through an early adoption scenario by company X. Assume for the purposes of this analysis that:

  * Users must engage in some sort of economic-related activity to sustain their extended detachment from reality
  * Maximizing economic gain necessitates some sort of service or product that large numbers of others consume, leading to most users choosing to inhabit a common "world" where interactions w/ large numbers of other virtual representations is possible
  * While interactions will likely be de-centralized, physical management of the hardware/softare necessary to generate this common world is likely to be central.

So, let's take company X. X is engaged in real estate in base reality: brokering the buying and selling of land. X is now interested in a virtual play. 

An early adopter has the following disadvantages:
  * They can be unplugged
  * They can mistime entry such that they re-enter base reality having no applicable skills

  Whereas IMO the single greatest risk to donning a headset and fully immersive haptic suit is the risk of being too early (or late) on the adoption curve.

  * Assume, for the purposes of this analysis, that both content and hardware are AAA, such that a headset and a haptic suit renders an experience that is not only indistuingishable from reality, but provides a 10x experience over base reality.

An early adopter has the following advantages:
  * Shape the world
  * Monetize the world

An early adopter has the following disadvantages:
