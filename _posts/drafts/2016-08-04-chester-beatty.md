Tucked away inside the grounds of Dublin Castle is the Chester Beatty Library, named after one of the 20th century's greatest collectors, Sir Alfred Chester Beatty. First off, he's an absolute G, check out his [bio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Chester_Beatty). Second, the man has a stellar eye for manuscripts. 

On display in 2016 was a selection of those manuscripts from Japan, including the [Tale of Genji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji). This is such a classic story. Low key knowledge drop: some historians consider this the first modern novel ever written. In the East Asian section of the library, as you wind around a long table, following foot after foot of beautiful, faded manuscript, the legend unfolds much like this:  

  * Genji is born as the son of the Emperor of Japan
  * Genji is disowned
  * Genji gets married
  * Genji sleeps with his stepmother/father's concubine
  * Genji kidnaps a pretty 10 year old
  * Genji has kid with aforementioned stepmother
  * Genji sleeps with said 10 year old after wife dies
  * Genji sleeps with another concubine, not aforementioned one
  * Genji is exiled
  * Genji sleeps with daughter of guy hosting him in village where he is exiled
  * Genji marries someone else, presumably sleeps with her
  * Genji dies  

They say we should learn from history. What's the lesson here friends?
