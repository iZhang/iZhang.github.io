The Jameson Distillery is an absolute champ about tours. They actually start a 45 minute long tour 30 minutes prior to closing, which leaves you a whole 15 minutes to peruse the Distillery Reserve collection at your leisure while the entire place is essentially closed.  

<!--end_excerpt-->

The tour guides spend the first 20 minutes teaching you about the distillation process for Jameson, then they load you up with 3 shots/person. My flight was Irish whiskey (Jameson), Bourbon (Jack Daniel's), and Scotch (Johnny Walker Black Label), each designed to highlight the not-so-subtle differences between them. Pro tip: if you go with a light weight you get all 6 shots for the price of 3.

Hilariously, but perhaps expectedly, the Irish tour guides will shit on American Whiskey (bourbon) during the tasting as being "too sweet." You know you drink buckets when bourbon is considered soft. And you finally learn why Scotch is smoky! Scotch must be produced in Scotland, and the geography near northern latitudes lends itself well to the creation of [peat bogs](http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/habitats-and-ecosystems/mountains-heaths-and-bogs/peat-bogs/). Peat is plant material, bloated with water, that hasn't fully decayed yet. Instead it sits in bogs, mires, wetlands, etc. until a Scottish whisky producer sends someone out to gather a bunch up, press the water out of it, and throw it in a fire. 

Barley, the key cereal in Scotch, must be dried/dehydrated during the malting process. The Scottish use peat extensively for drying, and that smoke imbibes the barley with a distinguished smokiness that your 60 year old hedge-fund-owner-uncle can't stop referencing.
