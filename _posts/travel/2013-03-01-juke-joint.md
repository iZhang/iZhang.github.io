Five minutes north of well-known [Beale Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beale_Street) in downtown Memphis is a small, soul-food joint called Alcenia's. This place has got soul y'all. Some people skip the beverages section on menus at smaller venues and lemme tell ya, that's a mistake at Alcenia's. Because you would miss out on something called "Ghetto-aid". I'm deadass serious. Ghetto-aid is, as you can guess, a ghetto form of [Kool-Aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool-Aid). It is literally sugar, water, and food coloring. It also happens to be heavenly.

On a side note, we have southern American Indian cuisine to thank for one of the staples of soul-food: corn. Cornbread, grits, corn on the cob -- even Jack Daniels, a true southern whiskey, contains an 80% corn mash.
