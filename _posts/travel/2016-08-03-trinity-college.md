The Trinity College Library is the largest in Ireland, and outside of being incredibly instagrammable (priority N), it also houses the Book of Kells (priority N+1).

Let's talk about the first thing that comes to mind when you hear "Book of Kells." For me, it's the song "Wild Boy" by Machine Gun Kelly. Note, the song has bad words. <br><br>

Look, I don't choose the associations that my brain selects, I just make you deal with them. However, if you think about it, it's an apt association. The Book of Kells houses the four Gospels of the New Testament, which cover the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. Google "Lebron James resurrection" and you'll see why the story of Savior --> Heretic --> Figurative Death --> Resurrection maps pretty much 1:1. Minus that 27-7-7 statline 'cuz ya boy Hay-Seuss was more of a sandals man, no J's.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk extra. The Book of Kells has incredibly ornate book bindings, with beautiful, filigree-like-work on manuscript pages with golden red hues and brilliant blues. The blues are what get me the most. While it's disputed whether [lapis lazuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_lazuli) was used to generate that type of eye-popping blue, lapis is a semi-precious stone found in northeastern Afghanistan and was ground into a fine powder for use in "top-shelf" paintings/works of art. Ish was expensive.
